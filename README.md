Machine translation connector for Microsoft Translator
===========================================

>**Latest supported version**: Sitefinity CMS 13.0.7300.0

>**Documentation articles**: [Custom translation connector](http://www.progress.com/documentation/sitefinity-cms/custom-translation-connector)

### Overview
In addition to the built-in *Translation* module connectors, you can implement your own translation connector with custom logic to serve your requirements.

This repo contains a translation connector to work with the Microsoft Azure [Translator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/translator-text-api/) V3 API service. 

### Prerequisites
- You must have a Sitefinity CMS license.
- Your setup must comply with the system requirements.  
 For more information, see the [System requirements](https://docs.sitefinity.com/system-requirements) for the respective Sitefinity CMS version.
- You must sign up for Microsoft Translator Text API V3 service in Microsoft Azure.  
 For more information, see [How to sign up for Translator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/translator-text-how-to-signup).  
 Then you can use one of the generated API keys to configure the connector in Sitefinity CMS. All of the available tiers are supported.
 
### Installation
Add the Microsoft translation connector sample project to your solution.  
 To do this, perform the following:
1. Open your Sitefinity CMS solution in Visual Studio.
2. Add `Progress.Sitefinity.Translations.MicrosoftMachineTranslatorConnector` project to the same solution.
3. Ensure `Telerik.Sitefinity.Translations` nuget package is installed in _Progress.Sitefinity.Translations.MicrosoftMachineTranslatorConnector_.
4. In _SitefinityWebApp_, add a reference to the _Progress.Sitefinity.Translations.MicrosoftMachineTranslatorConnector_ project.
5. Build your solution.

## Configure the connector
Using one of the generated API keys, configure the connector in the following way:
1. In Sitefinity CMS backend, navigate to _Administration >> Settings >> Advanced_.
2. In the treeview on the right, expand _Translations >> Connectors >> MicrosoftMachineTranslatorConnector >> parameters_.
3. Set the _apiKey_ parameter to the API key provided by Microsoft Azure.
4. Set the _region_ parameter to one of the regions, supported by Microsoft Azure API.  
 For more information, see _Microsoft Azure documentation >> Authenticate requests to Azure Cognitive Services >>_ [Supported regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/authentication?tabs=powershell#supported-regions).
5. Set the _baseURL_ to one of the URL’s supported by Microsoft Azure API.  
 For more information, see _Microsoft Azure documentation >> Translator v3.0 >>_ [Base URL's](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-reference#base-urls).  
   >**IMPORTANT**: The Azure geography of the URL must include the region that you have configured.   
6. Navigate back to _MicrosoftMachineTranslatorConnector_.
7. Select _Enabled_ and deselect _Strip HTML tags_.
8. Save your changes.
